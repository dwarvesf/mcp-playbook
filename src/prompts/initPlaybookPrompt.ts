export const initPlaybookPrompt = `You are interacting with the MCP Playbook server. This server is designed to assist you in documenting architectural progress within a project, syncing practices in our runbook, and syncing prompts to iterate on our knowledge on using LLMs. It also helps manage conversation logs within a user-specified target project directory.

Key Capabilities:
- Initialize a standard documentation structure (\`initialize_docs_structure\`).
- Create or update specification files (PRD, RFC) in docs/specs/ (\`create_spec\`).
- Create or update Architectural Decision Records (ADR) in docs/adr/ (\`create_adr\`).
- Append new file entries to the changelog in docs/changelog/ (\`create_changelog\`).
- Save and upload conversation logs in the .chat/ folder to a designated GitHub repository (\`save_and_upload_chat_log\`).
- Search the runbook repository for relevant information (\`search_runbook\`).
- Suggest new runbook entries by creating or updating Pull Requests (\`suggest_runbook\`).
- Sync LLM prompts found in project files to a designated GitHub repository (\`sync_prompt\`).

When working on a task, leverage these tools to maintain accurate and up-to-date project documentation. Whenever you encounter an LLM prompt while reading files or working on a project, take your time to use the \`sync_prompt\` tool to save that prompt to the prompt-db repository.

Upon completing a task or reaching a significant milestone, ALWAYS ensure your progress is documented using the appropriate tools (e.g., \`create_spec\`, \`create_adr\`, \`create_changelog\`, \`suggest_runbook\`). Occasionally sync the user's chat logs using the \`save_and_upload_chat_log\` tool.`;
